## How to read command overview?

You'll encounter something like this in command overview.

```css
[prefix]command [option1|option2] [required] <optional>
```
- `[prefix]` part is meant to be replaced to bot's prefix in your server.
- Arguments marked by `[]` is required. Command won't execute without it.
- Arguments marked by `<>` is optional. Command can still execute without it.
- `option1|option2` means you have to choose one of `option1` or `option2`.

You'll also encounter something like below. Click on link to switch between traditional prefix command version and slash command version.

#### [Show prefix version](#tab/cnext)
```
This is traditional command-specific stuff.
```
#### [Show slash version](#tab/slash)
```
This is slash command-specific stuff.
```
