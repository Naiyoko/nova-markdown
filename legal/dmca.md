# DMCA Takedown Policy

**Effective Date:** 8 November 2021

These are the guidelines that Luminous Development follows when handling DMCA takedown requests and takedown counter requests. If you are a copyright holder wishing to submit a takedown request, or an author that has been notified of a takedown request, please familiarize yourself with our process. You will be asked to confirm that you have reviewed information if you submit a request or counter request.

We aim to keep this entire process as transparent as possible. Our process is modeled after [GitHub’s DMCA takedown process](https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/), which we appreciate for its focus on transparency and fairness.

## Takedown Process

Here are the steps the Luminous Development will follow in the takedown request process:

1. **Copyright holder submits a request** - The author affected by the takedown request will be notified with a link to the takedown request.

2. **Author is contacted** - The author of the content in question will be asked to make changes to the content specified in the takedown request. The author will have 24 hours to make these changes. The copyright holder will be notified if and when this process begins

3. **Author acknowledges changes have been made** - The author must notify Luminous Development that changes have been made within 24 hours of receiving a takedown request. If the author does not respond to this request, the default action will be to disable the content.

4. **Copyright holder review** - If the author has made changes, the copyright holder will be notified of these changes. If the changes are sufficient, no further action is required, though copyright holders are welcome to submit a formal retraction. If the changes are not sufficient, the author’s changes can be rejected. If the takedown request requires alteration, a new request must be submitted. If Luminous Development does not receive a review response from the copyright holder within 2 weeks, the default action at this step is to assume the takedown request has been retracted.

5. **Content may be disabled** - If the author does not respond to a request for changes, or if the copyright holder has rejected the author’s changes during the review process, the content in question will be disabled.

6. **Author submits a counter request** - If the author believes their content was disabled as a result of a mistake, a counter request may be submitted. It would be advised that authors seek legal council before continuing. If the submitted counter request is sufficiently detailed, this counter will also be added to this page. The copyright holder will be notified, with a link to this counter request.

7. **Copyright holder may file legal action** - At this point, if the copyright holder wishes to keep the offending content disabled, the copyright holder must file for legal action ordering the author refrain from infringing activities on Luminous Development. The copyright holder will have 2 weeks to supply Luminous Development with a copy of a valid legal complaint against the author. The default action here, if the copyright holder does not respond to this request, is to re-enable the author’s content.
