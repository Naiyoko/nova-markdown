# Basic Setup
#### This tutorial will show you how to set up basic functionality with Nova. This should take **less than 5m**.

1. If you haven't already, invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=711428816127393844&permissions=470150208&scope=bot%20applications.commands). The default prefix is `l?`. **Add the prefix to the beginning of each command** in this tutorial.

2. If you have a **bot** role in your server, add it to Nova so it has permissions to speak in the channel you normally set up bots in.

3. Tell Nova which channels are for your partnerships and affiliates by using the `[prefix]partnerchannel add #chan` & `[prefix]affiliatechannel add #chan` commands.

4. Try sending a Discord invite link in your partnership and affiliate channel (**Can not be your own server**). You can use `discord.gg/test` - you should get a response that looks like **this**:

5. Lastly, you can have Nova count weekly partnerships for each user as well - enable it by running `[prefix]setautoweekly on`.
